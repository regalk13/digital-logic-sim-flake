# Digital Logic Sim on Nix ❄️

This flake and the override package try to simplify the execution of the https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim project (A minimalistic digital logic simulator) on Nix.

This project has no releases on github or any other platform that we can easily fetch, instead SebLague uses ItchiIO https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim, for this I downloaded the linux build from itch.io and uploaded it to this project as a release. But you can do the same by copying my ./package.nix and replacing it wherever you have the zip file found on [here](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim/download/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNzQ3NjU5NzY5LCJpZCI6MzQ1NjMxOH0%3d%2eVF8YkFNrB7IOVfkR1ZS1k%2bA3xZw%3d).

> This project is made on Unity so if you have the Unity Editor you can build the project by yourself. 

> I'm not responsible for the code that is executed since the project, even though it is open source, is uploaded to an external platform which the owner uses.

## Screenshoot 🖌️


## Run the app 🚀

You can run the app using the flake like.

```bash
nix run .
```
Or you can directly install the override on your system using the package.nix.


### Resources 📙
